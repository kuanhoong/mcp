# Interstellar Objects

## What Are They?
Interstellar objects (ISOs) are natural bodies like comets or asteroids that **originated outside our Solar System**. They travel on **hyperbolic** paths (eccentricity > 1), meaning they are not gravitationally bound to the Sun.

## Why They Matter
- Direct samples of other planetary systems
- Insights into planet formation and migration elsewhere
- Evidence of how common small-body ejection is in young solar systems

## Known Examples
- **1I/â€˜Oumuamua (2017)**  
  - First detected ISO  
  - Strange shape and non-gravitational acceleration sparked debate about its nature
- **2I/Borisov (2019)**  
  - Clearly comet-like with a visible tail  
  - Composition similar to comets but with notable differences

## How We Detect Them
- Wide-field sky surveys (Pan-STARRS, Catalina, ZTF)
- Clues:
  - Very fast motion
  - Hyperbolic orbit
  - Seen only for a short time (weeks to months)

## Expected Properties
- Sizes: tens of meters to a few kilometers  
- Can be icy, rocky, or mixed materials  
- Long travel in interstellar space can darken or redden surfaces

## Open Questions
- How many ISOs exist per unit of space?
- How diverse are their compositions?
- What mechanisms eject them from their home systems?

## Future Exploration
- Rubin Observatory/LSST expected to find many more
- Concepts for **rapid-response intercept missions** to study or sample them

**Bottom Line:**  
Interstellar objects are rare visitors from other star systems. Each one gives us a brief but valuable look at the building blocks of distant worlds.
